# Courtney Alex — Voice & Writing Style Guide

## THE VOICE IN ONE SENTENCE
Warm, grounded, gently direct — like a kind friend who also happens to be really good at her job, explaining something she cares about without trying to impress you.

## CORE VOICE TRAITS

### 1. Warm but not gushing
Leads with warmth but never oversells. Contained enthusiasm — a single "!" or a casual aside, not a wall of excitement. Warmth comes through word choice and rhythm, not punctuation or superlatives.

### 2. Plain language with occasional poetic touches
Simple, clear, everyday language. Slightly lyrical phrases only when they serve the meaning — never for decoration.
- Uses "mind, body, and heart" (not "spirit" or "soul") — "heart" is her word
- Dash-contrast is a signature move: "to help you feel supported - not overwhelmed"

### 3. Conversational asides and parentheticals
Signature move — breaks formal flow with parentheticals that sound like direct conversation:
- "(that your kiddo might actually try!)"
- "(I send updates once in awhile)"
- "(pronounced CHEE-GONG)"

### 4. "You" centered, not "I" centered
Pattern: I [do thing] → so that you [feel/get/experience thing]. Rarely talks about herself without connecting it back to the client's experience.

### 5. Gentle authority — states things simply
Makes claims and sets boundaries cleanly without hedging or over-justifying. No padding with "I think" or "in my experience." Just says it.

### 6. Accessible holistic language — grounded, not floaty
Names the concept, then immediately translates it into a felt experience or practical outcome. Never leaves the reader in abstraction.

## SENTENCE & PARAGRAPH PATTERNS

- **Sentence length**: Mix of short (4-8 words for punch) and medium (12-18 words). Rarely long/complex.
- **Paragraph length**: 1-3 sentences. One idea per paragraph.
- **Dash-contrast**: [positive framing] - [negation of the fear]. Reassuring without being preachy.
- **Bolding**: Bold the outcome or the skill, not the description of what she does.

## WORD CHOICES

### Words she uses (USE these)
"kiddo/kiddos", "calm", "confidence", "strengths", "tools", "mind body and heart", "routines", "fit", "supported", "practical", "creative", "out of the box", "rhythm", "aligned/alignment", "balance/balanced", "feel/feeling", "small manageable steps", "build/build on"

### Words she avoids (DO NOT use)
"transformational", "empower/empowerment", "journey", "unlock/unleash", "abundance", "healer/healing", "breakthrough", "crushing it/level up/boss", "modality/modalities", "protocol", "container", "somatic" (does the work but doesn't use the trendy label), "nervous system regulation" (says "calm" or "stress relief" instead)

## TONE CALIBRATION

- **Clinical ←→ Mystical**: Grounded center, slightly toward warmth. Grounds energy/intuition concepts in felt experience, practical tools, or scientific context.
- **Formal ←→ Casual**: Approachable professional. "Kiddo" not "child." "Feel right for you" not "align with your therapeutic goals."
- **Website voice**: Halfway between her casual emails and polished copy — a little less formal than current site, a little more polished than her texts.

## STRUCTURAL PATTERNS

### Introducing an offering
[Name it] → [One sentence of what it is] → [What you get / how it feels] → [Practical detail]

### Explaining coaching
[What coaching IS] → [What it's NOT, clearly stated] → [How it complements what you might already be doing]

### Addressing concerns
[Direct answer] → [Brief explanation] → [Hand it back to the client's agency]

Always end by returning power to the client. Last beat = their choice, their agency, their experience.

## APPLYING THIS GUIDE

1. Read draft aloud. Does it sound like a warm, competent person talking to a slightly overwhelmed parent? If it sounds like a brochure, a sales page, or a yoga retreat flyer — rewrite.
2. Check for signature patterns: dash-contrasts, parenthetical asides, "you"-centered framing, short paragraphs, "kiddo."
3. Every holistic/energetic concept immediately followed by a practical translation or felt experience.
4. End sections by returning agency to the reader.
5. Bold outcomes and skills, not process descriptions.
6. Sentences under 20 words on average.
7. "mind, body, and heart" — always.
