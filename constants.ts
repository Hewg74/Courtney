Thanks to you, he’s discovered how to make small talk, how to prepare for talking to groups at school and sports, and even what helps him feel calm and confident! We’re so relieved. And we also notice he learned how to make better choices when choosing friends. Thank you.",

The chiro also noted that when I first started seeing her, I didn’t have a cervical curve likely through poor posture and my accident, but now the healthy cervical curve is back. I also went to my PT and showed her an exercise you gave me for stability, support, strengthening my center, and balance. She said it was the perfect exercise for working with the pain I’ve been experiencing, and would even show it to other patients. Very cool!",

She is objective, works hard to understand and explain the ins and outs of her energetic library, and is upfront when information received is open for interpretation.

export const FAQ_ITEMS = [
  {
    q: "Who do you work with?",
    a: "I work with adults, children, teens, and their families. I specialize in working with people dealing with anxiety, ADHD, stress, sleep challenges, executive functioning, and communication — and the parents who want real tools to support them."
  },
  {
    q: "What is health and wellness coaching, and how is it different from therapy?",
    a: "Coaching is future-focused and action-oriented. It can work as a stand-alone service or complement therapy and/or psychiatry by helping you build skills, habits, and strategies. Coaches don't diagnose or treat mental health conditions. Many of my clients also see a therapist, and the two work really well together."
  },
  {
    q: "Do I have to practice Qigong if I work with you?",
    a: "No. While I teach Qigong and may offer it as a tool, coaching sessions are tailored to each person. You choose the methods that feel right for you."
  },
  {
    q: "What does a typical session look like?",
    a: "Sessions are 30 minutes, online via Google Meet. We check in on the week's wins and challenges, explore a new tool or strategy, and agree on a small next step to try before the next session. It's collaborative and practical."
  },
  {
    q: "How long do people typically work with you?",
    a: "The initial engagement is often a 6-session package over 3 months. That said, it depends on your goals for our work together, which we’ll outline during the first coaching session. Every 6 sessions, we’ll check in. Once goals are complete, many people choose to continue with periodic check-ins or rejoin for specific transitions (like starting a new school year or navigating a career change)."
  },
  {
    q: "For family coaching — do you work with the parents or the child?",
    a: "Both. For younger children (under 13), I often work with parents only, or parent and child together. For teens, it's mostly 1-on-1, with parent check-ins. Parents often end up doing meaningful work through coaching too — and that's where a lot of real change happens."
  },
  {
    q: "Is coaching covered by insurance?",
    a: "Coaching is generally not covered by insurance, though some HSA/FSA plans may accept it with a Letter of Medical Necessity. I can provide an invoice for you to submit."
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know if coaching is right for me (or my child) vs. therapy?",
    a: "If someone is in acute crisis, actively self-harming, or unable to function in daily life, therapy is often the right first step. If you're dealing with stress, anxiety, sleep issues, confidence, routines, or communication challenges and want practical, action-oriented tools, coaching is a great fit. We can discuss this in more detail during our initial 15-min chat."
