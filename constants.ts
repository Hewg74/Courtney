Once nearly debilitated by anxiety, he now has confidence and courage and tools to help him curtail negative thoughts. He has learned to embrace his unique talents rather than fear or suppress them. You have made such a difference in his life!",

After six months, she knows what to do when she feels upset, is more helpful around the house, communicating what she needs and why so that we argue less. She is doing well in school, calmer overall, and she sleeps through the night after you helped her figure out what was keeping her up (the bedding!). She's more confident in who she is and I'm so proud of her!",

export const FAQ_ITEMS = [
  {
    q: "Who do you work with?",
    a: "I work with adults, children (ages 6–17), teens, and their families. I specialize in working with people dealing with anxiety, ADHD, stress, sleep challenges, executive functioning, and communication — and the parents who want real tools to support them."
  },
  {
    q: "What is health and wellness coaching, and how is it different from therapy?",
    a: "Coaching is future-focused and action-oriented. It can work as a stand-alone service or complement therapy and/or psychiatry by helping you build skills, habits, and strategies. Coaches don't diagnose or treat mental health conditions. Many of my clients also see a therapist, and the two work really well together."
  },
  {
    q: "Do I have to practice Qigong if I work with you?",
    a: "No. While I teach Qigong and may offer it as a tool, coaching sessions are tailored to each person. You choose the methods that feel right for you."
  },
  {
    q: "What does a typical session look like?",
    a: "Sessions are 30 minutes, online via Google Meet. We check in on the week's wins and challenges, explore a new tool or strategy, and agree on a small next step to try before the next session. It's collaborative and practical."
  },
  {
    q: "How long do people typically work with you?",
    a: "The initial engagement is often a 6-session package over 3 months. Many people choose to continue with periodic check-ins or rejoin for specific transitions (like starting a new school year or navigating a career change)."
  },
  {
    q: "For family coaching — do you work with the parents or the child?",
    a: "Both. For younger children (under 10), I spend about 30–50% of the time with parents. For teens, it's mostly 1-on-1, with parent check-ins. Parents often end up doing meaningful work too — and that's where a lot of real change happens."
  },
  {
    q: "Is coaching covered by insurance?",
    a: "Coaching is generally not covered by insurance, though some HSA/FSA plans may accept it with a Letter of Medical Necessity. I can provide an invoice for you to submit."
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know if coaching is right for me (or my child) vs. therapy?",
    a: "If someone is in acute crisis, actively self-harming, or unable to function in daily life, therapy is the right first step. If you're dealing with stress, anxiety, sleep issues, confidence, routines, or communication challenges and want practical, action-oriented tools, coaching is a great fit."
