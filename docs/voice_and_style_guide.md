# Courtney Alex — Voice & Writing Style Guide (Updated)

## Purpose
This document analyzes Courtney Alex Aldor's writing voice for courtneyalex.com. Use this to write all site copy, emails, and social posts.

**CRITICAL SHIFT (Feb 2026):**
The brand voice is moving **AWAY** from "sensitive/intuitive/psychic/empath" labels and **TOWARD** "stress resilience/anxiety/practical tools."
*   **Target Audience:** Overwhelmed parents of kids with anxiety, ADHD, sleep issues, or meltdowns. They don't necessarily see their kid as "sensitive" — they see the struggle.
*   **Primary Goal:** Helping families breathe easier through practical, evidence-informed routines.

## THE VOICE IN ONE SENTENCE

Warm, grounded, gently direct, and **results-oriented** — like a kind, expert friend who helps you find practical solutions for your family's stress without judgment or fluff.

## CORE VOICE TRAITS

### 1. "Stress Resilience" over "High Sensitivity"
We are no longer leading with "sensitivity" or "intuitive gifts."
*   **DO NOT USE:** "Psychic," "Healer," "Spirit," "Soul," "Chakra," "Woo-woo," "Polyvagal Theory" (too technical), "Ben Health/Lyra" (use "leading mental health company").
*   **INSTEAD USE:** "Stress resilience," "Anxiety," "ADHD," "Sleep problems," "Communication," "Emotional regulation," "Mind-body tools" (instead of holistic), "Evidence-informed," "Practical strategies."

**Why?** Parents are dealing with concrete behavior issues (meltdowns, school refusal). "Sensitivity" can sound like a weakness or be missed entirely.

### 2. Warm but not gushing
She leads with warmth but never oversells.
*   **From the site:** "Hi, I'm Courtney!", "modern life can be a doozy."
*   **Avoid:** "Transformation," "Journey," "Abundance," "Divine," "Sacred container."

### 3. "You" centered & Empowering
Focus on the client's agency.
*   "You choose the methods that feel right for you."
*   "Coaching complements therapy by helping you build skills."
*   **The pivot:** Instead of "uncovering hidden gifts," say "helping your child find their strengths and where they shine."

### 4. Gentle Authority & Responsibility
*   **Clear scope:** Courtney is a COACH, not a therapist. She does not diagnose or treat.
*   **Differentiation:** Therapy looks back/heals wounds (be careful distincting this, don't generalize too clearly/negatively); Coaching is future-focused and action-oriented.
*   **Medication:** We never imply coaching is an *alternative* to medication. It's a support/complement.

### 5. Plain Language
*   **"Mind, body, and heart"** (NOT spirit/soul).
*   **"Kiddo"** or **"Child"** (Use "Child" in formal headers, "Kiddo" in casual text/voice).
*   **"Tools"** not "Modalities."
*   **"Real-world strategies"** not "Holistic interventions."

## STRUCTURAL PATTERNS

### The "Sound Familiar?" Section
*   Focus on **symptoms**: "Anxiety runs the show," "Meltdowns after school," "Trouble sleeping."
*   Don't focus on: "Your child is misunderstood" (too abstract).

### Offerings
1.  **Coaching:** Practical, strength-based, one-on-one.
2.  **Calm Kid Program:** Results-focused. NO mentioning "workbooks" or "video lessons" (clients don't do them). Focus on the **toolkit** and **weekly themes**.
3.  **Workshops:** For parents. Focus on communication & resilience.
4.  **Qigong:** Separate entity. Just a class schedule for locals. "Mindful movement" not "Energy healing."

### Addressing "Woo" Skepticism
"I'm grounded and research-guided. I use mind-body tools because they work, not because they're trendy."
